# Assignment-4

This is my fourth assignment in the Programming Hero Next Level Web Development course platform. I am very excited to share and describe my project with you.

This is a car shop management application that consists of three collections: One is user collection, another is product collection, and the other is order collection. The product collection involves creating, fetching, updating and deleting product/s operations. The order collection handles order management as well as manages generating overall revenue.

Here is the description of how I have set up my project environment, the technologies I have used, how to run and inspect the project.
